    - [X] Plot the residual errors R = C - F
    - [X] Calculate the RMSE and MAPE with respect to the test set for the model
- [X] Fitting a cubic model to the training data F = gamma_0 + gamma_1*t + gamma_2*t**2 + gamma_3*t**3
    - [X] Estimate values for gamma_0, gamma_1, gamma_2, and gamma_3
    - [X] Plot the residual errors R = C - F
